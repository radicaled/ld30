Oscar the Friendly Planet.
==========================

*The Universe is Filled with Jerks.*

You have to observe several planets in a solar system and determine
which planet is friendly. Should you fail, face the scorn of other, less
polite planets.

Gameplay
--------

Basically observe the planets and wait for a clue to see which one
is friendly and which are just jerks.

You have 3 attempts and 40 (?) seconds.
