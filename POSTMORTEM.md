My reflections on participating in LD30.
(yes, I'm writing this before the compo even ends)

I didn't know I was going to do LD30
------------------------------------

About one hour and 16 minutes before LD30 began, I decided completely on
a whim to participate. No warm-up, no real experience game developing since
... ... ... since I can't even remember how long ago.

I had no plan, no code, and no idea what any of the themes were going to be.

Too much time spent on technical matters
----------------------------------------

I spent several hours on Friday trying to get semi-decent terrain
generation based on perlin noise going. Then, on Saturday I spent even more
time trying to vary the kinds of worlds that were generated. I only started
working on actual gameplay mechanics during the Sunday, last day.

The Ungame
----------

I originally intended to have the worlds talk to each other.
The user was to see which worlds had friendly interactions with the other world,
and then using the communications as a clue determine which world as the
"friendly" world to visit by clicking on it.

World to world communication never made it in, unfortunately, since I had
other things scheduled for Sunday (see first section) and I spent too much
time dawdling and playing with other things instead of getting the gameplay
going first.

In the end what I made was a game of chance: 3 tries, 10 planets.
