My reflections on participating in LD30.
(yes, I'm writing this before the compo even ends)

I didn't know I was going to do LD30
------------------------------------

About one hour and 16 minutes before LD30 began, I decided completely on
a whim to participate. No warm-up, no real experience game developing since
... ... ... since I can't even remember how long ago.

I had no plan, no code, and no idea what any of the themes were going to be.

Too much time spent on technical matters
----------------------------------------

I spent several hours on Friday trying to get semi-decent terrain
generation based on perlin noise going. Then, on Saturday I spent even more
time trying to vary the kinds of worlds that were generated. I only started
working on actual gameplay mechanics during the Sunday, last day.
